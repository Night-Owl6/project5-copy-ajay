Hi, 

This page is deployed in page8. 

My work
- session state
- cookies
- buttons for staff, member, admin
- service deploy in webstrar
- service directory


to check session state
- when you run the program, you will get session state count on top left. When you run the session
  it will show the count of 1. Copy the url, and open it in another brower, the count will then be 
   updated to 2.

To check cookies
- My group partner's member, staff and admin page were not functioning after download. I had reached out
  to them regarding this, but I did not get any response. So to show my cookies work, I have created a
  demo example. Below member page it says username. Enter any name, then click (not press enter) login
  button. Below that is a display screen, it saves the user profile and outputs the user name. This is 
  just a demo. I am demostrating that I have understand and working cookies. Once there staff and member
  page is working, I can convert it to storing user profile and session state from shared sessions. You can
  enter as many names you want in that field. 

Buttons
- I have added buttons that lead to their respective location. It will lead to member page, staff page,
  and admin page. There is also a return to default page from those web page. Except member page which
  needs to be done by other group memeber yet. 

Serice directory
- There is an embbed pdf viewer which list all the application, functionalty, author, input, output etc


How to run this:
- Due to unresponsiveness from my group member and riddled with errors. I had to make what I had. Both 
  of them work and one of them is in Detriot who is not asnwering to group chat for couple days now. I  
  could not get access to them. So you can please just run web "application.sln" then click 
  on "ISS Express (google chrome)" on top middle screen. This should run it perfectly and you can test 
  and run everything.
